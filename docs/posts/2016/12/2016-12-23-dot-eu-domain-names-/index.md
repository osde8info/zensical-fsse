https://eurid.eu/en/register-a-eu-domain/domain-names-with-special-characters-idns/

_Following the amendment of [EC Regulation 874/2004](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32004R0874), on 6 May 2015 EURid introduced a revised mechanism for handling Internationalised Domain Names containing non-ASCII characters (shift from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008) as well as the so-called “homoglyph bundling”._

_.eu domain names that have been registered_

-     _with hyphens in the second, third and fourth position, or_
-     _with “ŀ” (L followed by middle dot but not followed by a subsequent L), or_
-     _with "ı" (dotless i)_

_are **no longer** supported._
