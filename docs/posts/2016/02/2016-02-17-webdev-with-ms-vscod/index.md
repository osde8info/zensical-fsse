_VS Code is based on the Monaco editor that is also part of the F12 dev tools found in MS Edge and IE. It was also part of Visual Studio Online that was part of Azure Websites. It does use Electron (which started life as part of Atom) for the frame of the app, which allows it to be hosted as a cross platform app._
