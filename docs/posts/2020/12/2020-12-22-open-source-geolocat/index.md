> [Kepler.gl](http://www.kepler.gl/) is a data-agnostic, high-performance web-based application for visual exploration of large-scale geolocation data sets. Built on top of [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com) and [deck.gl](http://uber.github.io/deck.gl/#/), kepler.gl can render millions of points representing thousands of trips and perform spatial aggregations on the fly.
> 
> Kepler.gl is also a React component that uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage its state and data flow. It can be embedded into other React-Redux applications and is highly customizable. For information on how to embed kepler.gl in your app take a look at this step-by-step [tutorial](http://vis.academy/#/kepler.gl/) on vis.academy.
