It may be obvious by now that I am a 'lazy' 'ONE pkg person' for example ive been using Firefox on every home/corp desktop and VirtualBox on every home/corp desktop for many years now !

Yes I know there are OTHER browsers and OTHER hypervisors but I only want to learn ONE tool whatever my hardware platform is !

That is my excuse why my Raspberry Pi's B/B+ have been gathering dust as i cant face learning a distro (raspbian ?) JUST for ARM. So at OOWLON last week I was shocked to learn Oracle Linux 7 has been available for over 2 years (and that there is a specific oracle yum repo for ARM - apparently AARCH64 means ARM)
