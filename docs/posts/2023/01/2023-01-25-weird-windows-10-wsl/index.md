here's a weird intel core 2 duo p8400 windows 10 wsl 2 oracle linux 9 bug

workaround : use wsl oracle linux 8.6

apparently this can also be a problem with CentOS GNU/Linux & Rocky GNU/Linux !

```
Enter new UNIX username: user1
Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2
Enter new UNIX username: user2
Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2
```
