fido - a ps script to download windows isos

useful because of MCT issues such as _regardless of the manner in which Microsoft's Media Creation Tool produces its content, because no two MCT ISOs are ever the same (due to MCT always regenerating the ISO content on the fly) it is currently impossible to validate with absolute certainty whether any ISO that was generated by the MCT is safe to use. Especially, unlike what is the case for retail ISOs, it is impossible to tell whether an MCT ISO may have been corrupted after generation._
