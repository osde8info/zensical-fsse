redwoodjs is now redwoodsdk

_A simple framework for humans. Server-first React with zero magic. Built to stay understandable. RedwoodSDK begins as a Vite plugin that unlocks SSR, React Server Components, Server Functions, and realtime features. Its standards-based router, with support for middleware and interruptors, gives you fine-grained control over every request and response. With built-in access to Cloudflare Workers, D1 (Database), R2 (Storage), Queues, AI, and full local emulation via Miniflare, development feels just like production._
