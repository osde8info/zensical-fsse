sometimes a UI turns up that is so amazing it blows you away ie the android [Radio Garden](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonathanpuckey.radiogarden&hl=en) app world / country / city chooser

its a 3D spinning / zoomable globe that lets you choose country and city and radio station

i never want to have to choose a country / city from a dropdown combo EVER AGAIN

why not try it on [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) if you dont have an android
