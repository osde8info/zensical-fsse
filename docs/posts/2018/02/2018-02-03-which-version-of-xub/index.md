Which version of xubuntu should i use 16 LTS, 17.04, 17.10 or 18 LTS ?

If you want at least a year of the support then the answer is still xubuntu 16 LTS since 17.04 is already end of life (and is broken) and 17.10 (was broken) and only has 6 months left

- https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-16-04-release/
- https://xubuntu.org/news/17-04-eol/
- (and its impossible to upgrade 17.04 to 17.10)
- https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-17-10-release/
