goog morse code keyboard beta

- https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-p-accessibility-features/

_Google has added Morse code input to Gboard — its mobile keyboard app. Currently available in beta, users can customize the Morse code settings to align with their specific needs. It can also be used with Switch Access, allowing you to use the feature with outside devices as well. After switching to the Morse code layout, you’ll then be able to enter text using the dot and dash from Morse code._
