Software Composition Analysis (SCA) apps from @synksec and @whitesourcesoftware

- https://snyk.io/
- https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/

If you want to detect vulnerable dependencies in your GitHub project with snyk you will need to make sure your project has a manifest file so snyk can decide what frameworks you are including.

- https://app.snyk.io/login
- https://support.snyk.io/getting-started/languages-support

_To get proper test results and create Snyk projects, at least one of the relevant manifest files must be present in the tested folder (CLI), repository (SCM) or app (serverless)._

You get a great report showing you issues in your projects

You can also connect Snyk to BitBucket, Docker and GitLab
