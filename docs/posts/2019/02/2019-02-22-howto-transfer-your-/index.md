howto transfer your domains to @cloudflare and pay wholesale prices

- get a cloudflare account https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/
- setup your domains to use cloudflare cdn (by using their nameservers)
- wait a bit
- click on option to transfer domain to cloudflare
- unlock domain on current registrar
- enter unlock code into cloudflare
- wait for domain transfer to complete
- change DNS to point to your servers IP address

NOTE domain redirects are broken on cloudflare so DO NOT use cloudflare unless you have an IP address for your server
