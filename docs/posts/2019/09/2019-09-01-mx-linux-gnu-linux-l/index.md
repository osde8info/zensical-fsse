MX Linux #GNU/linux lets you choose between sysvinit or systemd

https://mxlinux.org/manuals/

_MX Linux uses systemd-shim, which emulates the systemd functions that are required to run the helpers without actually using the init service. This means that SvsVinit remains the default init yet MX Linux can use Debian packages that have systemd dependencies such as CUPS and Network Manager. This approach also allows the user to retain the ability to choose his/her preferred init at boot by clicking on "Advanced options" and selecting the systemd one._
