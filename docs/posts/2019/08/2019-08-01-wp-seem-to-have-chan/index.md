WP seem to have changed the default FREE subdomain on the "Create a shiny new WordPress.com page" (https://wordpress.com/jetpack/new?ref=calypso-selector) from YOURSITE.wordpress.com to YOURSITE.home.blog !

I just tried to create a new AIDLML blog but WP only gave me the option to choose:

- https://aidlml.home.blog/

BUT you can overide this by chosing the BUSINESS or PROFESSIONAL option on the WP [site-type](https://wordpress.com/start/site-type?ref=calypso-selector) choice blog page instead of the BLOG option

- https://aidlml.wordpress.com/
