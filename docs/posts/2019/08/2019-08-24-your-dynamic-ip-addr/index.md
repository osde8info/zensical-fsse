your dynamic ip address might be more dynamic than you realise if your ISP is using CGN !

- https://www.hyperoptic.com/faq/posts/static-ip-addresses/

_HyperOptic use Carrier Grade Nat (CGN) which allows for more efficient use of our IPv4 address range. This means that each time you access an IPv4 website, our network seamlessly allocates you a dynamic, rather than static, IP address from our pool of public addresses, with no disruption to service. This has no impact on the security of your connection – it’s simply about how we manage the allocation of our available IP addresses._

_There are, however, some applications that may be affected by this. These include applications such as online gaming, VPNs, P2P applications and hosting at homes._
