my @fon #fonone has finally died after it had been working continuously for 5 years

- https://fon.com/

@fon stopped providing updates 2 years ago but i wonder if they have they now been sending out internet system msgs to brick them remotely ?

SUGGESTION : if your startup promises free LIFETIME internet access i suggest you provide a REFUND as soon as you change your policies
