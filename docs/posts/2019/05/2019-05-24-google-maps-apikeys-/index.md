_As of June 11, 2018, you must enable billing with a credit card and have a valid API key for all of your projects. This will give you the ability to scale easily with less downtime and fewer performance issues. In addition, we’ve simplified our 18 individual APIs into three products: Maps, Routes, and Places._
