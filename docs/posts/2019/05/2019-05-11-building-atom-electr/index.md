[Electron](https://electronjs.org) _is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux._
