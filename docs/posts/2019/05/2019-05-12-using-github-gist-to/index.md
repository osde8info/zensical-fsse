using github gist to search for code examples

for example type in a url such as 'fantasysports.yahooapis.com' or 'weather-ydn-yql.media.yahoo.com' into the github gist search page

- https://gist.github.com/search?q=fantasysports.yahooapis.com
- https://gist.github.com/search?q=weather-ydn-yql.media.yahoo.com

what is really nice is you can then choose the language such as java or python
