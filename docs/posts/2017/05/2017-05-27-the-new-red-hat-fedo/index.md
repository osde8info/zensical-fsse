_Red Hat Satellite 6 is a re-engineering of the Red Hat Satellite 5 product._

_Satellite 6 has been built from the ground-up on different and more modern technologies. Spacewalk is not the upstream for Satellite 6, and never will be. Instead Satellite 6 is a federation of several upstream open source projects, including Katello, Foreman, Pulp, and Candlepin._

_Spacewalk (and its downstream product, Red Hat Satellite 5) is a systems-management tool, and Satellite 6 is designed to accomplish the same set of goals._
