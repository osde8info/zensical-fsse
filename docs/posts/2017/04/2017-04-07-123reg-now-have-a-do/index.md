_7.1. 123 Reg offers a backorder service for already registered domains (‘the Backorder Service’ and ‘Backorder’ shall be construed accordingly) which attempts to automatically register a domain (‘the Backorder Domain’) on behalf of the Client if and when the Backorder Domain becomes available for registration by the general public. Such availability would be following any applicable Grace and/or Redemption Periods._

_7.2. The Backorder Service is only available on selected domain extensions as specified on 123 Reg’s website._

_7.3. The Client will be advised of an estimated availability date via the Client’s control panel, however, such date is an estimate only and 123 Reg shall not be responsible for any inaccuracy in the estimated date._

_7.4. Payment for successful Backorders must be made by the Client within 28 days of confirmation of the same failing which the Backorder Domain will be removed from the Client’s control panel and 123 Reg shall be entitled to deal with the Backorder Domain as it deems appropriate._
