windows 10 enterprise cb or windows 10 enterprise ltsb

- http://windowsitpro.com/windows-10/understanding-long-term-servicing-branch-and-current-branch-windows-10

seems to be a similar idea to the ubuntu regular (CB) and ubuntu long term support (LTS) releases so if you choose a non lts or non ltsb releases you will get newer (and less stable) features more often and more quickly

for production use id always stick with a LTS or LTSB release
