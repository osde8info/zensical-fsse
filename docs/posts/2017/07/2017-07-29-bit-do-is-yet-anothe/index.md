if you are fed up with /ZXF4T3 style short links try bit.do that lets you CHOOSE the shortlink for example

- http://bit.do/osde
- http://bit.do/shoes

unlike goo.gl where stats are shown by inserting /info/ into the url like https://goo.gl/info/tw0zDN on bit.dostats are available by adding a - to the end of the shortlink thus

- http://bit.do/osde-
- http://bit.do/shoes-

short url admin pages

- https://bit.do/admin
- https://goo.gl/
