intel are running a webserver on your intel core vpro, i5, i7, i9 "business" pc at localhost:623 and localhost:16992 (using intel me mei amt rpat)

just browse to http://localhost:623 or http://localhost:16992 on your "business" pc now

pc's based on intel "consumer" chipsets should not be affected and you will see NOTHING but on DELL OptiPlex, LENOVO ThinkPad and HP EliteBook "business" PCs you may see the text "INTEL ACTIVE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY"
