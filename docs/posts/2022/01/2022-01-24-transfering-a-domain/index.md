transfering a domain may leave a ghost record #netadmin #webmaster

- https://www.name.com/support/articles/206127197-domain-still-in-account-after-an-outgoing-transfer

_When an [outgoing transfer](https://www.name.com/support/articles/205188898-transfer-away-from-name-com) completes, the domain will occasionally remain in your [Name.com](https://www.name.com/) account for up to a week, but this is only a ghost image. These ghost images can occur due to a process that verifies that the outgoing transfer was successful before the domain name is removed._

_During this week-long period, you will not be able to manage your domain. While this may seem inconvenient, it is how we guard against domains being prematurely removed from customers' accounts._
