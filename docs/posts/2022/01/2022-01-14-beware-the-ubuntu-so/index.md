beware the @ubuntu #software gui (by @rhughes) #snap app installs nonopen apps as root but i thought the whole point of snap was you didnt need to be root ?

if you accidentally installed brave you can uninstall it from the command line with

```
$ snap remove brave
```

but you will need a SUDO or ROOT password to do that
