im not complaining (!) in fact i love the fact that M$ authenticator even logs me in to iphone apps if i have previous logged into their parent websites in M$ edge

what i am confused about is that M$ authenticator works completely differently to goog authenticator and whenever a website asks me to authenticate via a QR code i can only use the goog one
