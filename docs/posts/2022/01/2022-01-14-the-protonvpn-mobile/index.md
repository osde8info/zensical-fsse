**the @proton mobile vpn's do not seem to protect tethered clients #privacy #netadmin #sysadmin**

ive always wondered if it did but today i checked my primary iphone that runs protonvpn which i need because the @vodafone @voxi proxy block @deviantart

deviantart works fine on that iphone but all my tethered asus & moto devices are still blocked and whatismyipaddress says they are still in the UK while my primary iphone appears to be in NL

a second bug is that the voda voxi proxy warning msg does NOT appear in safari
