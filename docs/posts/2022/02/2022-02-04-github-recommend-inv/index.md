_By clicking "Add Successor", I acknowledge that I am the owner of MY account, and am authorizing GitHub to transfer content within that account to my GitHub Successor, designated below, in the event of my death. I understand that this appointment of a successor does not override legally binding next-of-kin rules or estate laws of any relevant jurisdiction, and does not create a binding will._
