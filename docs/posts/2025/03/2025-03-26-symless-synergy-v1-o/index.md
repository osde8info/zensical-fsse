the @symless #synergy download page is massively confusing it defaults to downloading v3 which DOES NOT work with any existing v1 keys

instead goto

[https://symless.com/synergy/download/package/windows-10/synergy\_1.17.1\_windows\_x64.msi](https://symless.com/synergy/download/package/windows-10/synergy_1.17.1_windows_x64.msi)

to get v1 download

install then enter any existing v1 key
