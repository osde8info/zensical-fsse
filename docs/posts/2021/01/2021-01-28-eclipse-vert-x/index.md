summary

> is a tool-​kit for build­ing re­ac­tive ap­pli­ca­tions on the JVM. Re­ac­tive ap­pli­ca­tions are both scal­able as work­loads grow, and re­silient when fail­ures arise. A re­ac­tive ap­pli­ca­tion is re­spon­sive as it keeps la­tency under con­trol by mak­ing ef­fi­cient usage of sys­tem re­sources, and by pro­tect­ing it­self from er­rors.
