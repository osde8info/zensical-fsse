CentOS is gone—but RHEL is now free for up to 16 production servers - so why didnt they announce this on the SAME DAY ? #mktg #fail

NOW YOU HAVE A CHOICE

- Oracle Linux
- Red Hat LInux

and YOU SHOULD NO LONGER USE CENTOS ON PRODUCTION SERVERS because

> the lack of a long, well-defined life cycle made it inappropriate for most production use and, especially, production use by shops that chose a RHEL-compatible distribution in the first place.
